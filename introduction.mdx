## Introduction

Data Engineering is entering into its golden age. It has been progressively and _somewhat slowly_ making this journey until the widespread adoption of Generative AI - making the golden age inevitable and here now.

At Datangle, we believe that the right data changes lives â€“ whether is to be used in the management of security resources of **3.2 million residents** of a State in Nigeria or the research for the **cure of cancer** in the UK. We have lived these realities first-hand and that is why we believe that the enablers of the right data need the right tools.

Across different organizations, our team have seen data engineers - the enablers of right data - struggle with the operational tasks and how that impacts their focus on more strategic work, inadvertly affecting how much we can improve our daily lives. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence is not going to slow this down any time soon, therefore, if we need the right data delivered fast and reliably, we need to help data engineers automate data operations **(DataOps)** and to do that efficiently, we need to ensure that they use tools made specifically for data engineers (and not tools built for software engineers).


Datangle abstracts away the complexity of software engineering tools, empowering data-driven organizations and teams to focus more on strategic tasks that deliver innovation by providing enterprise-grade functionalities. Our integration with your existing data stack and tools like Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud Query and Amazon Redshift, ensures that we meet you where you are, simplify your data operations and efficiently deliver reliable data faster.

**Datangle allow data teams to build, test and deploy their data pipelines using a no-code workflow builder and intelligent automation.**
